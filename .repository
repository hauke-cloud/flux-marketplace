title: Flux Marketplace
description: |
  This repository provides all the Helm/OCI/Kustomize deployments as Flux
  manifests, which [hauke.cloud](https://hauke.cloud) also uses.

  - We keep the versions up-to-date
  - The deployments are tested in our development and staging environments
  - We set (in our opinion) good, generally valid default values
  - Of course, these deployments are somewhat tailored to our needs, but
    we try to keep them as generally valid as possible
  - Missing components (such as secrets) are documented
  - Here you can find example deployments of applications we develop and maintain
