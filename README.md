This repository provides all the Helm/OCI/Kustomize deployments as Flux manifests, which [hauke.cloud](https://hauke.cloud) also uses.

- We keep the versions up-to-date
- The deployments are tested in our development and staging environments
- We set (in our opinion) good, generally valid default values
- Of course, these deployments are somewhat tailored to our needs, but
  we try to keep them as generally valid as possible
- Missing components (such as secrets) are documented
- Here you can find example deployments of applications we develop and maintain
