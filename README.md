# Flux Marketplace

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hauke-cloud/.github/main/resources/img/organisation-logo-small.png" align="right" alt="hauke.cloud logo" width="109" height="123">

This repository provides all the Helm/OCI/Kustomize deployments as Flux
manifests, which [hauke.cloud](https://hauke.cloud) also uses.

- We keep the versions up-to-date
- The deployments are tested in our development and staging environments
- We set (in our opinion) good, generally valid default values
- Of course, these deployments are somewhat tailored to our needs, but
  we try to keep them as generally valid as possible
- Missing components (such as secrets) are documented
- Here you can find example deployments of applications we develop and maintain
